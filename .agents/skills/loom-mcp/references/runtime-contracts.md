# Runtime Contracts

Use this file for current loom-mcp runtime behavior in this repo. Prefer it over stale external notes.

## Planner Streaming

- `PlannerContext.ModelClient(id)` returns a runtime-decorated client.
- With the decorated client, drain the `Streamer` yourself with `Recv()`.
- Do not pass a decorated stream to `planner.ConsumeStream`.
- Use `planner.ConsumeStream` only with a raw `model.Client`.
- Mixing the two paths double-emits thinking and assistant text events.

## Agent-As-Tool

- Agent-as-tool runs as a real child workflow, not an inline local shortcut.
- Parent and child runs are linked with a `ChildRunLinked` event.
- Parent tool results carry a `RunLink` to the child run.
- Runtime execution goes through `ExecuteAgentChildWithRoute`.
- `AgentToolConfig.Route` is required; there is no fallback to ad hoc local lookup.
- Consumer-side prompt rendering is optional and payload-only. Provider-side context belongs in the provider planner/runtime, not the consumer.
- Generated helper packages expose `NewRegistration(...)`; runtime internals build the underlying registration with `runtime.NewAgentToolsetRegistration(...)`.

## Streams

- Streams are session-owned.
- `stream.StreamProfile` controls visibility by audience.
- Child runs are linked, not flattened, by default.
- Use profile selection to shape chat, debug, or metrics views instead of changing core runtime behavior.

## Prompt Runtime

- `Runtime.PromptRegistry` stores baseline prompt specs.
- `runtime.WithPromptStore(...)` adds scoped overrides.
- Planners should render prompts through `RenderPrompt(...)` so provenance flows into model requests.

## Tool Execution Contracts

- Runtime-owned tool specs and codecs are the schema source of truth.
- Use generated `tool_specs.Specs` and codecs for payload/result schema and encoding needs.
- Do not introspect `docs.json` at runtime.
- Tool results and retry hints should stay structured; avoid best-effort coercion when contracts fail.
- Tool confirmation is runtime-owned. Design-time `Confirmation(...)` records
  `tools.ConfirmationSpec` on generated tool specs; runtime
  `WithToolConfirmation(...)` can require or override confirmation for specific
  tools. Confirmed calls emit `AwaitConfirmation`, resume through
  `ProvideConfirmation`, record a `ToolAuthorization` hook/stream event, execute
  only when approved, and return schema-compliant denied results when rejected.
- Tool-produced artifacts use `artifact.Content` on `planner.ToolResult.Artifacts`;
  runtime persistence converts them to workflow-safe `artifact.Ref` values on
  planner outputs, API tool events, hook payloads, and memory records.
- Model-facing artifact access is design-owned through `Toolset("artifacts",
  FromArtifacts(MaxArtifactBytes(...), MaxArtifacts(...)))`. Generated
  registration must use `runtime.NewArtifactToolsetRegistration(...)` and the
  application runtime must provide `runtime.WithArtifactStore(...)`.
- Model-facing memory access is design-owned through `Toolset("memory",
  FromMemory(MemoryMaxResults(...)))`. Generated registration must use
  `runtime.NewMemoryToolsetRegistration(...)`; `scope:"current_run"` falls back
  to `runtime.WithMemoryStore(...)`, while `scope:"indexed"` requires
  `runtime.WithMemorySearcher(...)` and otherwise returns an
  `unsupported_operation` retry hint.
- Long-term memory is a separate `memory.Service` contract with entry-shaped
  `PutEntry`, `IngestRun`, `IngestEvents`, and `Search` operations. Generated
  `FromMemory(MemoryLongTerm(), ...)` registrations pass
  `rt.MemoryService` and `rt.MemoryScopeResolver`, expose `search_memory`, and
  accept only query/filter payload fields from the model. Visibility and scope
  are design/runtime-owned and must not be controlled by tool payloads. Tool
  results use model-facing hits and must not expose raw scope, source
  references, or metadata from stored entries.
- Planner-input memory preload is opt-in through generated
  `RunPolicy.PreloadMemory`. It fills `planner.PlanInput.PreloadedMemory` and
  `planner.PlanResumeInput.PreloadedMemory` with bounded snippets without
  changing default transcript/history behavior.
- Long-term preload is opt-in through generated
  `RunPolicy.PreloadLongTermMemory`. It searches with the latest
  history-filtered user text and fills `PreloadedMemoryEntries`, leaving raw
  transcript event preload unchanged. Planners that want prompt text should use
  `memory.FormatEntriesForPrompt(...)` rather than inventing ad hoc formatting.

## Interceptors

- Interceptors are opt-in typed interfaces: run, tool, model, and event.
- Runtime-level interceptors execute before agent-scoped interceptors.
- Generated `RunPolicy(func(){ Interceptors("id") })` stores interceptor IDs;
  application code supplies implementations with `runtime.WithNamedInterceptors(...)`.
- `PlannerContext.ModelClient(id)` applies model interceptors after cache and
  tool-policy decorators and before tracing. Raw clients passed directly to
  `planner.ConsumeStream` are not wrapped by runtime model interceptors.
- `BeforeModel` may return a response to short-circuit non-streaming
  completions. Streaming calls do not synthesize a `model.Streamer` from that
  response; returning one from `BeforeModel` on `Stream` fails the call.
- Event interceptors run in `runtime.publish_hook` before `appendHookRunEvent`,
  stream publication, and hook-bus publication. Dropped events must be absent
  from all three surfaces.
- Interceptor errors short-circuit the active path.

## Workflow Composition

- Plain `Workflow` plus `Step` remains source-compatible and generated through
  `planner.NewSequentialWorkflowPlanner(...)`.
- Graph helpers (`Parallel`, `Join`, `RequestInput`, `Loop`, `Branch`) generate
  `planner.NewGraphWorkflowPlanner(...)`.
- Graph workflow resume state is derived from stable node/tool-call IDs in
  `ToolOutputs`, not from `len(ToolOutputs)`.
- Parallel resume must schedule only unfinished ready nodes. Joins are virtual
  dependency barriers. Loops must be bounded by `MaxIterations`.
- `RequestInput` emits `AwaitTypedInput`; answers resume via
  `Runtime.ProvideTypedInput` and enter `PlanResumeInput.TypedInputs`, not
  `ToolOutputs`.
- The branch default DSL helper is `BranchDefault` to avoid colliding with Goa's
  `Default` helper in dot-imported designs.

## Skills

- `runtime/mcp/skills` is the shared discovery and read path for MCP
  `SkillDirectory(...)` resources and model-facing `Toolset(FromSkills(...))`
  tools.
- `SKILL.md` frontmatter supports `id`, `name`, `description`,
  `allowed_tools`, `preload`, and `reload`. Skills without frontmatter remain
  compatible by deriving the ID from the directory name and description from the
  first heading or text line.
- Duplicate skill IDs, invalid frontmatter, unknown preload modes, and unknown
  reload modes are hard discovery errors.
- Generated `FromSkills(..., SkillPreload(...), SkillReload(...))`
  registrations wire `runtime.NewSkillToolsetRegistration(...)`; model-facing
  `list_skills` and `load_skill*` results include parsed metadata.

## Debug Server

- `runtime/agent/debug` is opt-in application code, not a DSL or generated API
  surface.
- `debug.NewServer(debug.Config{Runtime: rt})` defaults to `127.0.0.1:0`.
- Debug responses use `{data:...}` and `{error:{code,message}}` JSON
  envelopes for run snapshots, events, await state, memory, artifacts, and
  workflow counts.
- The debug server must read runtime stores without changing planner, hook,
  stream, MCP, or generated API behavior.
